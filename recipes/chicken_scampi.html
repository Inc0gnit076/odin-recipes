    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lightly fried chicken in a lemon sauce</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 pound thinly-sliced chicken cutlets, cut into 1/2-inch-thick strips </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil </li>
        <li>8 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes </li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry white wine </li>
        <li>12 ounces angel hair pasta </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest plus the juice of 1 large lemon </li>
        <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan  </li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta. Sprinkle the chicken with some salt. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat until hot, then add the oil. Working in 2 batches, brown the chicken until golden but not cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per batch. Remove the chicken to a plate.</li>
        <li>Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in the skillet. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook until the garlic just begins to turn golden at the edges, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add the wine, bring to a simmer and cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook the pasta until very al dente, reserving 1 cup of the pasta water. Add the pasta and 3/4 cup pasta water to the skillet along with the chicken, lemon zest and juice and the remaining 4 tablespoons butter. Return the skillet to medium-low heat and gently stir the pasta until the butter is melted, adding the remaining 1/4 pasta water if the pasta seems too dry. Remove the skillet from the heat, sprinkle with the grated cheese and parsley and toss before serving.</li>
    </ol>
